# Charles Hadfield

I am a mathematician working within FinTech in NYC.

I defended my PhD at École normale supérieure in Paris in June 2017.

I was a Morrey Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at UC Berkeley during the 2017 / 2018 academic year before spending a period in Quantum Computing.

I want to understand the naive idea behind the relationships between torsions and zeta functions.
We'll finish by having a finite dimensional appreciation of the analytic torsion.

### Cohomological definition of torsion

We start with an overly trivial setting of a very short complex of vector spaces:

$$
(C^\bullet, d) := 0 \to C^0 \xrightarrow{d} C^1 \to 0
$$

with $$C^\even=C^0$$, $$C^\odd = C^1$$. Choosing a basis $$\c$$ for $$C$$ gives
a matrix representation of $$d$$ from which we may calculate the determinant.
The torsion is then
$$
\tau_{(C^\bullet, \c)} = \det \left( d : C^\even \to C^\odd \right).
$$

More generally an acyclic complex $$(C^\bullet, d)$$ has a contraction
$$\eta$$ satisfying $$d\eta + \eta d = 1$$. The torsion, with respect to a basis
$$\c$$, is

$$
\tau_{(C^\bullet, \c)} = \det \left( d + \eta : C^\even \to C^\odd \right).
$$

We can push the calculations much further if we have a metric floating around:

- Naively we should think of $$\eta$$ being built from the adjoint of $$d$$
in the presence of some metric on $$C^\bullet$$. This would give $$d^*$$ and
$$\Delta = (d+d^*)^2$$ from which $$\eta = \Delta^{-1} d^*$$.

- We see $$C^j$$ decomposed as $$K^j\oplus B^j = \ker d \oplus \range d^*$$.
And $$\Delta = d d^* |_K + d^*d |_B$$ so we introduce notation for the determinants:
$$\delta_j = k_j \cdot b_j$$. Note that $$b_j = k_{j+1}$$.

- We write $$\tau^2 = \det ((d+\eta)(d+\eta)^*:C^\odd\to C^\odd)$$
and on $$K^j\oplus B^j$$ the operator is diagonal:
$$(d d^*) \oplus (\Delta^{-2}d^* d)$$ whose determinant is $$k_j b_j^{-1}$$.
Therefore

$$
\tau^2
= \frac{k_1 k_3 \cdots k_N}{b_1 b_3\cdots }
= \frac{k_1 k_3 \cdots k_N}{k_2 k_4\cdots }
= \frac{\delta_1 \delta_3^3 \cdots \delta_N^N}{\delta_2^2 \delta_4^4\cdots }
= \prod_{k=1}^N (\det \Delta)^{(-1)^{k+1} k}
$$

In the above $$N$$ is the largest non-zero degree in $$C^\bullet$$.
(It must be odd for the torsion to be interesting to me.)

### Zeta function as determinant of operator

Consider a symmetric positive operator $$A$$ on $$\C^n$$. Writing it's eigenvalues as
$$0\le\lambda_1\le\dots\lambda_n$$,
one usually defines the associated zeta function as

$$
\zeta_A(s) = \sum_{\lambda_j > 0} \lambda_j^{-s}.
$$

We will define the zeta function dependent on two parameters:

$$
\zeta_A(s,\lambda) = \sum_{\lambda_j \neq -\lambda} (\lambda_j + \lambda)^{-s}
$$

which is effectively the zeta function for $$A+\lambda$$. Under a change of variables calculation using
the definition of the Gamma function, we may write

$$
\zeta_A(s, \lambda) = \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)} \int_0^\infty t^{s-1} \tr (e^{-t(A+\lambda)} - \Pi(\lambda)) \, dt
$$

where $$\Pi(\lambda)$$ is the projection operator onto the null space of $$A+\lambda$$.
From either formula for $$\zeta$$, we see that
$$
\log \det (A+\lambda) = -\left.\partial_s \zeta_A(s,\lambda) \right|_{s=0} .
$$

### Analytic torsion

Given a manifold $$M$$ of dimension $$N$$, the Laplacian $$\Delta$$ acting
on differential forms provides a zeta function $$\zeta_\Delta(s,\lambda)$$.
This provides the regularised determinant

$$
\log \det \Delta := -\left.\partial_s \zeta_\Delta(s,0) \right|_{s=0}
$$

This provides the definition of analytic torsion $$\tau$$ introduced by Ray and Singer:

$$
2 \log \tau = \left.\sum_{k=1}^N k (-1)^k \partial_s \zeta_\Delta(s,\lambda) \right|_{s=0, \lambda=0}
$$

which is equal to the Reidemeister torsion. This has been proved by Cheeger and MÃ¼ller.
